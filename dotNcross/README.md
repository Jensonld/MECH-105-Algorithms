## Dot and Cross Product Function
#### dotNcross is a function that calculates the dot and cross product of two vectors with 3 components.
#### Inputs:
* a1 - i component of the first vector
* a2 - j component of the first vector
* a3 - k component of the first vector
* b1 - i component of the second vector
* b2 - j component of the second vector
* b3 - k component of the second vector
#### Outputs:
* dotProduct - the scalar value of the dor product
* dotTheta - the angle between the two vectors
* crossProduct - an array containing the components of the cross product vector
* magnitudeCross - the magnitude of the cross product vector
#### Function Structure:
[dotProduct,dotTheta,crossProduct,magnitudeCross] = dotNcross(a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3)
