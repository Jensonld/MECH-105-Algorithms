## Linear Regression function
#### Compute the linear regression based on inputs:
* x: x-values for our data set
    * y: y-values for our data set
   Outputs:
    * fX: x-values with outliers removed
    * fY: y-values with outliers removed
    * slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
    * intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
    * Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
