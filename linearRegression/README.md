## Linear Regression function
#### Computes the linear regression of data sets while removing outliers based on inputs:
* x: x-values for our data set
* y: y-values for our data set
#### The function outputs:
* fX: x-values with outliers removed
* fY: y-values with outliers removed
* slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
* intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
* Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
#### Function Structure:
[fX, fY, slope, intercept, Rsquared] = linearRegression(x,y)
